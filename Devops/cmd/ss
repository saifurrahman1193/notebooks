# 🔄 Rename All Files and Directories: Replace Spaces with Underscores


To run the **rename preview command** for the **current directory and all its subdirectories**, just replace `/your/dir` with `.` (dot means "current directory"):

```bash
find . -depth -name "* *" -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do
  echo mv "$f" "${f// /_}"
done
```

### ✅ What this does:

* Recursively finds all **files and directories** with spaces in their names.
* **Prints** what the `mv` command **would** do (does not actually rename).
* Lets you verify before actually performing the rename.

---

### 🔁 If you're happy with the output, run the actual rename:

```bash
find . -depth -name "* *" -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do
  mv "$f" "${f// /_}"
done
```

Let me know if you'd like to exclude hidden files or only rename files (not folders).
