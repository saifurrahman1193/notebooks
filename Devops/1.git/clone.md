Nice 🎉 — your SSH setup is **working now** (since it started cloning).

If `git clone` is **hanging/stuck halfway** (e.g., at *Counting objects*), that’s usually not GitHub rejecting you anymore — it’s a **network issue**.

---

## 🔍 Common causes & fixes

### 1. **Slow/unstable connection**

Git is fetching a lot of objects, and a weak/unstable network can make it freeze.
👉 Try cloning with fewer parallel connections:

```powershell
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:Asaduzzaman285/socketioforwintel.git
```

(This only pulls the latest snapshot, not full history → much faster.)

Later, if you need full history:

```powershell
git fetch --unshallow
```

---

### 2. **Firewall/Proxy issue**

If you’re on a server or corporate network, firewall/proxy may be throttling SSH.
👉 Test if HTTPS works better:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Asaduzzaman285/socketioforwintel.git
```

---

### 3. **Git buffer size**

For large repos, increase Git buffer:

```powershell
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
```

---

### 4. **Check with verbose mode**

To see where it hangs:

```powershell
GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 git clone git@github.com:Asaduzzaman285/socketioforwintel.git
```

---

✅ Quick test: try `--depth=1` and/or HTTPS to confirm if it’s a network issue.
