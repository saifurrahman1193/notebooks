# Morphology in NLP

## What is Morphology?
Morphology is the study of the structure and formation of words. In **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, morphology helps in understanding how words are formed from **roots, prefixes, suffixes, and inflections**.

### 1. Root Word  
- The most basic, meaningful part of a word.
- They can function independently as words and serve as the foundation for forming new words through the addition of prefixes, suffixes, and infixes.
- Example:  
  - `running → run`  
  - From the words "running," "runs," and "ran," the root word is "run."
  - `happiness → happy` 
  - Happy (Root word: happy)
    - Prefix: un-: unhappy
    - Suffix: -ness: happiness
  - Cycle (Root word: cycle)
    - Prefix: bi-: bicycle
    - Prefix + Suffix: re- + -ing: recycling
  - Form (Root word: form)
    - Prefix: trans-: transform
    - Suffix: -ation: formation
