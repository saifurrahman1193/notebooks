# English Grammar to Know for NLP

## 1. Parts of Speech (POS)
- **Definition**: Categories of words based on their function in a sentence.
- **Examples**:
  - Nouns: "dog", "happiness"
  - Verbs: "run", "is"
  - Adjectives: "beautiful", "quick"
  - Adverbs: "quickly", "softly"
- **Relevance in NLP**: Used in POS tagging to understand sentence structure.

## 2. Sentence Structure
- **Definition**: The arrangement of words to form sentences.
- **Examples**:
  - Simple Sentence: "She runs."
  - Compound Sentence: "She runs, and he walks."
  - Complex Sentence: "Because she was late, she missed the bus."
- **Relevance in NLP**: Helps in syntactic parsing and understanding relationships.

## 3. Syntax and Grammar Rules
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Ensures subject and verb match in number.
  - Example: "He runs" vs. "They run."
- **Word Order**: English typically follows Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
  - Example: "She eats an apple."

---

## 4. Tenses
- **Definition**: Indicates the time of action.
- **Examples**:
  - Present: "I write."
  - Past: "I wrote."
  - Future: "I will write."
- **Relevance in NLP**: Important for temporal analysis and text generation.

## 5. Punctuation
- **Definition**: Marks used to structure sentences.
- **Examples**:
  - Period (.), Comma (,), Question Mark (?), Exclamation Mark (!).
- **Relevance in NLP**: Affects tokenization and sentence segmentation.

## 6. Clauses and Phrases
- **Clauses**: Groups of words with a subject and verb.
  - Example: "She sings because she is happy."
- **Phrases**: Groups of words without a subject-verb pair.
  - Example: "Under the table."
- **Relevance in NLP**: Helps in syntactic and semantic parsing.

---

## 7. Negation
- **Definition**: Expressing the opposite meaning.
- **Examples**: "She doesn’t like apples."
- **Relevance in NLP**: Important for sentiment analysis.

---

## 8. Active and Passive Voice
- **Definition**: Different ways to express actions.
  - Active: "The dog chased the cat."
  - Passive: "The cat was chased by the dog."
- **Relevance in NLP**: Helps in understanding tone and structure.

## 9. Word Formation
- **Definition**: How words are created or modified.
- **Examples**:
  - Root Words: "play"
  - Derivations: "player", "playful"
  - Inflections: "plays", "played"
- **Relevance in NLP**: Used in stemming and lemmatization.

## 10. Pronouns and Anaphora
