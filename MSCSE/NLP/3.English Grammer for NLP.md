# Grammar Concepts to Know for Context-Free Grammar (CFG)

## 1. Sentence Structure
- **Definition**: CFG defines the structure of sentences by breaking them into components like subject and predicate.
- **Key Terms**:
  - **Subject**: Who or what the sentence is about.
  - **Predicate**: Describes what the subject does or is.
- **Example**:
  - Sentence: *The cat sleeps.*
  - CFG: `S → NP VP`

---

## 2. Parts of Speech
CFG rules often use parts of speech as non-terminal symbols.

### **Noun (N)**
- Represents people, places, things, or ideas.
- **Example**: `N → dog | city | happiness`

### **Verb (V)**
- Represents actions or states.
- **Example**: `V → runs | is | thinks`

### **Adjective (Adj)**
- Describes nouns.
- **Example**: `Adj → red | tall | happy`

### **Adverb (Adv)**
- Describes verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
- **Example**: `Adv → quickly | very | silently`

### **Pronoun (Pron)**
- Replaces nouns.
- **Example**: `Pron → he | she | they`

### **Preposition (Prep)**
- Indicates relationships between words (e.g., direction, location).
- **Example**: `Prep → on | in | under`

### **Conjunction (Conj)**
- Connects words, phrases, or clauses.
- **Example**: `Conj → and | but | or`

---

## 3. Phrases
CFG defines phrases as hierarchical structures composed of parts of speech.

### **Noun Phrase (NP)**
- **Structure**: `(Det) + Adj* + N + (PP)`
- **Example**: *The tall building in the city*
- **CFG**: `NP → Det Adj* N (PP)`

### **Verb Phrase (VP)**
- **Structure**: `V + (NP) + (PP)`
- **Example**: *ate the cake with a fork*
- **CFG**: `VP → V NP (PP)`

### **Prepositional Phrase (PP)**
- **Structure**: `Prep + NP`
- **Example**: *on the table*
- **CFG**: `PP → Prep NP`

---

## 4. Clauses
- **Independent Clause**: A complete thought with a subject and predicate.
- **Dependent Clause**: Cannot stand alone; often introduced by subordinating conjunctions (e.g., `because`, `if`).
- **CFG Example**: `S → NP VP`

---

## 5. Terminal vs. Non-Terminal Symbols
- **Terminals**: Actual words in a language (e.g., `dog`, `runs`).
- **Non-Terminals**: Abstract categories representing grammatical structures (e.g., `Noun`, `Verb Phrase`).
- **Example CFG**:
  - `S → NP VP`
  - `NP → Det N`
  - `VP → V NP`

---

## 6. Recursion
- **Definition**: CFGs use recursion to handle nested phrases or repeated patterns.
- **Example**:
  - `S → S Conj S`
  - Sentence: *The boy ran and the girl walked.*

---

## 7. Punctuation
- **Definition**: Punctuation is treated as terminals in CFG.
- **Example**:
  - `S → NP VP "."`
  - Sentence: *The cat sleeps.*
