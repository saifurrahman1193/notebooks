### üîç **PEAS: Component Breakdown**

Here are the **key points** of the **PEAS** framework in AI:

---

### üîë **PEAS ‚Äì Key Points**

1. **P = Performance Measure**
   * **Question to ask:** What makes the agent's actions successful?
   * Performance we want from the agent.
   * goals or rewards for the agent.
   * Criteria to evaluate the agent's success.
   * Quantifies how well the agent is doing.
   * Measures the effectiveness of the agent.
   * Can be specific to the task or general.
   * Defines what success looks like for the agent.
   * Guides the agent's behavior.
   * Questions
     * > What is the goal of the agent?
     * > How do we measure success?
     * > What metrics define success?
     * > What should the agent maximize or minimize (e.g., accuracy, reward, score, time, fuel)?
     * > Are there penalties or negative outcomes to avoid?
   * Example: Speed, Accuracy, efficiency, safety, user satisfaction.
2. **E = Environment**
   * **Question to ask:** What is the world the agent exists in?
   * The world in which the agent operates.
   * Includes everything the agent interacts with.
   * Example: Roads (for cars), users (for chatbots), opponents (in games).
   * Questions
     * > What does the **environment** look like?
     * > Is it **fully or partially observable**?
     * > Is it **static or dynamic**?
     * > Who or what else exists in the environment?
     * > Are there **external forces or unpredictability**?
3. **A = Actuators**
   * **Question to ask:** What are the tools the agent uses to make changes in its environment?
   * agent perform actions with actuators
   * Physical or virtual components that perform actions.
   * Change the state of the environment.
   * Execute the agent's decisions.
   * Tools the agent uses to take action.
   * Responsible for changing the environment.
   * Executes decisions made by the agent.
   * Example: Wheels, arms, API calls, response outputs.
   * Questions
     * > What actions can the agent take?
     * > What **mechanisms or outputs** does the agent use to affect the environment?
     * > What **controls** or **actions** are available?
     * > Can it move, speak, write, manipulate objects?
4. **S = Sensors**
   * **Question to ask:** How does the agent gather information about its environment?
   * Gain/perceive/observe information from the environment.
   * Tools used to perceive the environment.
   * Collects data for decision-making.
   * Example: Cameras, GPS, keyboard input, microphones.
   * Questions
     * > How does the agent perceive the environment?
     * > What **inputs** does it use?
     * > What tools or data does it use to **sense the world**?
     * > How much of the world can it see?
     * > Is the data **real-time, noisy, or limited**?

# Types of environments

In Artificial Intelligence, the **type of environment** an agent operates in significantly affects how it should behave or be designed.

Here are the **main types of environments** in AI, with **simple explanations and examples**:

---

### 1. **Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable**

| Type                     | Description                                                             | Example               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Fully Observable**     | Agent has access to the **entire environment state** at each time step. | Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe    |
| **Partially Observable** | Agent has **limited or incomplete** view of the environment.            | Poker, Driving in fog |

---

### 2. **Deterministic vs. Stochastic**

| Type              | Description                                                          | Example                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Deterministic** | Next state is **completely determined** by current state and action. | Solving a puzzle         |
| **Stochastic**    | Next state involves **randomness or uncertainty**.                   | Dice games, Stock market |

---

### 3. **Episodic vs. Sequential**

| Type           | Description                                           | Example                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Episodic**   | Each task (episode) is **independent** of the others. | Image classification, Spam detection |
| **Sequential** | Current decision **affects future decisions**.        | Chess, Robot navigation              |

---

### 4. **Static vs. Dynamic**

| Type        | Description                                                 | Example                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Static**  | Environment **doesn't change** while the agent is thinking. | Crossword puzzle                  |
| **Dynamic** | Environment **can change** during decision-making.          | Self-driving car, Real-time games |

---

### 5. **Discrete vs. Continuous**

| Type           | Description                                          | Example                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Discrete**   | Limited number of clearly defined states or actions. | Chess (finite positions)                |
| **Continuous** | Infinite or very fine-grained states/actions.        | Robot arm movement, Temperature control |

---

### 6. **Single Agent vs. Multi-Agent**

| Type             | Description                                             | Example                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Single Agent** | Only **one agent** interacts with the environment.      | Crossword solving              |
