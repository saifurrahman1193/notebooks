## Population vs Sample

| **Aspect**        | **Population**                                       | **Sample**                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Whole Dataset       | A subset of the population    |
| **Definition**     | The entire group you're interested in studying       | A subset of the population used to represent the whole   |
| **Size**          | Usually large (could be infinite)                    | Always smaller than the population                       |
| **Examples**       | All adults in Bangladesh                             | 500 adults randomly selected/picked from Dhaka/population                  |
| **Purpose**        | True data or parameters (e.g., true average income) | To estimate characteristics of the population            |
| **Symbols used**   | μ (mean), σ (standard deviation), N (size)           | x̄ (mean), s (standard deviation), n (size)              |
| **Cost and Time** | Expensive and time-consuming to collect              | Cheaper and quicker to collect                           |
| **Accuracy**      | Provides complete information                         | Provides estimates, subject to sampling error            |

# Difference between z-test and t-test


## Z-test vs T-test

| **Aspect**               | **Z-test**                                           | **T-test**                                           |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Used When**            | Population standard deviation (σ) is known          | Population standard deviation is **unknown**         |
| **Sample Size**          | Large sample size (n ≥ 30)                          | Small sample size (n < 30)                          |
| **Distribution Used**    | Standard normal distribution (Z-distribution)       | Student’s t-distribution                            |
| **Test Statistic**       | Z = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)                              | t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)                              |
| **Accuracy**             | More accurate for large samples                     | More accurate for small samples                     |
| **Applications**         | Comparing sample and population means, proportions | Comparing two sample means or paired data           |
| **Example**              | Mean height of 1000 people vs national average      | Exam scores of 25 students vs class average         |

### ✅ In Short:
- Use **Z-test** when the sample is **large** and **σ (population SD) is known**.
- Use **T-test** when the sample is **small** and **σ is unknown**.
