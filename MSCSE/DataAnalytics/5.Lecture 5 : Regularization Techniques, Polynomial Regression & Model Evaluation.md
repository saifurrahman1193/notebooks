# ⚠️ Limitations of Ordinary Linear Regression
### 1. **Multicollinearity**

* Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other.
* When independent variables are **highly correlated**, it becomes hard to estimate the coefficients accurately.
* Leads to **unstable** and **unreliable** models.
* Multicollinearity denotes when independent variables in a linear regression equation are correlated.

## 📏 Example: Height in Inches vs. Height in Meters

| Person | Height (inches) $x_1$ | Height (meters) $x_2$ | Weight (kg) $y$ |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| A      | 60                    | 1.524                 | 45              |
| B      | 65                    | 1.651                 | 55              |
| C      | 70                    | 1.778                 | 65              |
| D      | 72                    | 1.829                 | 70              |
| E      | 75                    | 1.905                 | 75              |

### 🔁 Relationship

$$
x_2 = x_1 \times 0.0254
$$

This means **Height in meters is linearly dependent** on Height in inches → **perfect multicollinearity**.

### 🧠 Why This Is a Problem in Regression

Suppose we try to model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Height\_inches} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Height\_meters} + \epsilon
$$

The model will **fail to assign unique values** to $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, since both inputs contain the **same information**.

### 🧮 Correlation

$$
\text{Corr}(x_1, x_2) \approx 1
$$

Meaning they are **perfectly correlated**, causing:

* Inflated **standard errors**
* Unstable **coefficients**
* High **VIF values**
