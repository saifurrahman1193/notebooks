### **Script: Climate, Environment & Economy 

**I'm Saifur Rahman**

**Slide 1: Introduction**
Hello everyone, I’m Saifur Rahman.
Today I’ll present how **climate, environment, and economy** are interrelated — and what data tells us about these connections.

---

**Slide 2: Dataset Overview**
I worked with a merged dataset containing:

* **Weather data** (temperature, rainfall)
* **Environmental data** (AQI, forest cover, emissions, Rainfall)
* **Economic data** (GDP, poverty, literacy, Unemployment)

Merged by **year**, this allowed **cross-domain analysis** — like GDP vs. emissions.

---

**Slide 3: Data Cleaning**

* Removed missing values
* Cleaned % and currency values (e.g., 45% → 0.45, \$1.2B → 1.2 billion)
* Ensured everything was numeric and analysis-ready

---

**Slide 4: Key EDA Insights**

* Weather: Max temp rising over time
* Economy: GDP increasing, poverty falling, emissions rising
* Urban population growing fast
* Rainfall model: ↑Humidity & clouds = ↑Rain; ↑Temp & sunshine = ↓Rain

---

**Slide 5: Regression Results**

* **Poverty rate** drops with ↑Literacy & ↓Unemployment
* **Forest cover** and **rainfall** have positive effects on GDP
* **Drought** and **cyclone counts** hurt agriculture and increase poverty
* **GDP growth** is linked to higher **max temperatures**

---

**Slide 6: Hypothesis Tests Summary**
✅ Forests, carbon, rainfall, and drought significantly affect the economy
✅ GDP affects climate — especially temperature
❌ No clear link between GDP and AQI
❌ No strong evidence that poverty increases disaster exposure

---

**Slide 7: Conclusion**

* Environment and economy are deeply connected
* Policy should focus on **education**, **climate resilience**, and **sustainable growth**

---

**Slide 8: Thank You**
Thanks for listening.
I’m happy to take any questions!
