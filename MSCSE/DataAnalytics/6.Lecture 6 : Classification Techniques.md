# Classification
- supervised learning technique
- predict categorical class labels/ categories / classes
- categories like discrete or nominal (e.g., "spam" or "not spam", "yes" or "no", "disease" or "no disease")
- used to classify new, unseen data by predicting the class label based on the input attributes
- Example
  - Email: spam vs. not spam
  - Medical diagnosis: has disease vs. no disease
  - Loan approval: approved vs. rejected
  - Pass or Fail
  - True or False (1 or 0)

## Types of Classification Problems

### 1. Binary Classification
- **Definition**: 
  - The model predicts one of **two possible classes**.
  - Classifies data into one of two distinct classes.
  - predict 1 from 2 classes
- **Examples**:
  - Spam or Not Spam  
  - Disease or No Disease  
  - Pass or Fail  
  - True or False (1 or 0)
### Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, etc.

### 2. Multi-class Classification
- **Definition**: 
  - The model predicts one **out of more than two possible classes**.
  - Classifies data into one of three or more classes.
  - predict 1 from 3 or 3+ classes
- **Examples**:
  - Handwritten digit recognition (0â€“9)  
  - Animal classification (Cat, Dog, Horse, etc.)
  - Predicting student grades: A, B, C, D, F

### Algorithms: Softmax Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, etc.

### 3. Multi-label Classification
- **Definition**: 
  - Each instance can be **assigned to multiple classes simultaneously**.
  - each instance (data point) can be assigned multiple labels from a set of possible categories, rather than just one.
  - 
- **Examples**:
  - A news article labeled as both "Politics" and "Economy"  
  - A music genre classifier tagging a song as "Pop", "Rock", and "Electronic"  
  - A medical diagnosis identifying multiple conditions at once
  - Movie genre classification (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)
    - 1 movie 1 or multiple genre can be added
  - Multiple tags per input
