# A single Neuron
- A single neuron/perceptron (Forward propagation) is the fundamental building block of a neural network. It takes inputs, processes them using weights and a bias, applies an activation function, and produces an output.

The output of a single Neuron is

# Activation Function
- An activation function is a mathematical function that determines whether a neuron should be activated or not by calculating weighted sum and adding bias
- mathematical functions applied to the output of a neuron.
- It introduces non-linearity into the output of  a neuron

## 2 Types of Activation Functions

### Linear Activation: 
- No transformation between input and output. So, input will be output.

### Non-Linear Activation Functions
- Non-linear activations increase the functional capacity of the neural network, because it allows it to present non-linear relationships between features in the input.
