# Deep Learning
- Deep learning (DL) is a sub-set of machine learning (ML) to extract patterns from big data using artificial neural networks. An artificial neural network (ANN) is the piece of a computing system designed to simulate the way the human brain analy-
ses and processes information.
- Extract informative patterns from Big Data using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain, known as artificial neural networks.
- Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on using artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in data. 
- Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to analyze data and extract meaningful patterns. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, allowing them to learn complex representations of data and solve intricate problems.
- Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns from data. It is widely used in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and more.
